loaded with knowledge and fun with practical real-life scenarios. Sir Ali shan was very cooperative and 
helpful throughout the semester. The lectures quality is well defined, clear for student understanding and 
most of all it sticks to the mind for a long time. The class environment was very friendly and collaborative 
like we all were learning new things from each and every person and it was just like an 'Agile Family'. I 
wish Sir ALI SHAN could really teach other courses as well and coach other teachers as well to provide 
and facilitate highly effective and engaging learning strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"29 An teacher like no other in simple words, he was a teacher, a guide, a friend, a support, a councilor and 
basically everything a graduating student might need, he valued everyone's opinion, never disregard 
anyone, promoted appreciation, supported students even those who don't speak in class started 
participating in class activities, 3 hours of class used to pass in few minutes and we would still feel fresh 
instead of sleepy or tired or exhausted which one can expect noting the schedule of class, he guided 
students not just for cource but for jobs, for career, for masters and for many other things a student 
might need, overall the best experience of university life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"30 A unique environment which stimulated the maximum output from the process of the lectures . Teacher 
was able to involve students within the lectures and still maintained decorum of the class. That is how a 
person quality teaching can be judged and sir you nailed on it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31 He is the best teacher I've ever had ❤,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32 100000000/10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,"The quality of lectures and learning environment was so good that had there been a second part of this 
course, I would've fought with the management to get myself registered into it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,"I had never learnt in such an interactive environment before. It has given me confidence and courage to 
share my point of view, to ask anything i wanted. Loved it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,"He has a very unique and interesting way of teaching. Didn't lose interest in his class. Everyone 
participates in his class. and the class environment was exceptionally maintained by the teacher and 
students.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,"The session is interactive, and the instructor enjoys explaining the subject by using the most relevant / 
simple example possible. One of FAST NUCES' top teachers. Others would be unable to present the 
lecture in the same manner as the instructor. I am confident that every agile class student will never 
forget the topics or content covered in class. Thank you FAST for giving us such an amazing instructor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"37 He gave his best to teach students a good environment to study and work as a team, he taught not to 
target anyone, listen to everyone's opinion and focus on learning togather rather than saying he is wrong 
or she is wrong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
